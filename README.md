I've created a simple app for viewing the weather. was created and designed by myself.

receive the API from openweathermap.org using react library for UI components and style by tailwind.

P.S. for now, just a desktop version. I would like to improve the design for desktop and for the mobile accessibility as well. ðŸ”œ
